/**
 * A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to
 * a resource (a servlet or static content), or on the response from a resource,
 * or both. <br>
 * <br>
 * Filters perform filtering in the <code>doFilter</code> method. Every Filter
 * has access to a FilterConfig object from which it can obtain its
 * initialization parameters, a reference to the ServletContext which it can
 * use, for example, to load resources needed for filtering tasks.
 * <p>
 * Filters are configured in the deployment descriptor of a web application
 * <p>
 * Examples that have been identified for this design are<br>
 * 1) Authentication Filters <br>
 * 2) Logging and Auditing Filters <br>
 * 3) Image conversion Filters <br>
 * 4) Data compression Filters <br>
 * 5) Encryption Filters <br>
 * 6) Tokenizing Filters <br>
 * 7) Filters that trigger resource access events <br>
 * 8) XSL/T filters <br>
 * 9) Mime-type chain Filter <br>

     * the FilterChain object (<code>chain.doFilter()</code>), <br>
     * 4. b) <strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to the

     * 5. Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next
     * entity in the filter chain.
